= Continuous Delivery

== Goals

This lab will guide you through building a BASIC continuous delivery pipeline using Jenkins, Artifactory, and Cloud Foundry.

== Exercise

. Review the link:EnablingContinuousDelivery.key.zip[Enabling Continuous Delivery] presentation

=== Set Up

==== Jenkins Setup Steps

We will leverage the Jenkins instance deployed by Ops Manager.

. Login to your Jenkins instance deployed by Ops Manager.  Use the `Admin` user under `UAA`.

. Navigate to `Manage Jenkins` > `Configure System`

. Add the JDK 1.8 installation under the `JDK` section
+
* `Add Installer` > `Install from java.sun.com`
* Agree to the license
* Provide your Oracle login information
* Ensure `Install automatically` is selected
+

. Add the latest stable Gradle under the `Gradle section`
+
* Ensure `Install automatically` is selected
* `Install from Gradle.org`

. Click `Apply` then `Save`

. Navigate to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins` > `Available`

. Ensure the following plugins are installed:
+
* Gradle (should be installed)
* Mask Passwords
* Extensible Choice Parameter Plugin
* Artifactory Plugin
* Parameterized Remote Trigger Plugin
+

. Tell Jenkins to restart after plugin install

=== Create the Initial Build Job

. Navigate back to Jenkins Home.

. Click `create new jobs`, give it a name and select `Build a free-style software project` Then click `OK`.

. Under `Source Code Management`, select `Git`, and supply your repository URL and credentials

. Under `Build Triggers`, select `Poll SCM` and provide the string `* * * * *` (every minute).

. Under `Build`, add a `Invoke Gradle Script` build step.
+
Gradle Version:: The one you created above
Build Step Description:: +build environment agnostic artifact+
Switches:: `-Pbuildversion=$BUILD_NUMBER`
Tasks:: `clean assemble`

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build Now''.

=== TODO Create the Deploy Job

. Navigate back to Jenkins Home.

. Click `New Job`, give it a name and select ``Build a free-style software project.'' Then click +OK+.

. Check `This build is parameterized`.

. Click +Add Parameter+ and choose +Extensible Choice+.
+
Name:: +BUILD_VERSION+
Description:: +The citytest build to promote.+
Choice Provider:: +System Groovy Choice Parameter+
Groovy System Script::
+
[source,groovy]
----
import jenkins.model.*
import hudson.model.*

def getAllBuildNumbers(Job job) {
  def buildNumbers = []
  (job.getBuilds()).each { build ->
    buildNumbers.add(build.getDisplayName().substring(1))
  }
  return buildNumbers
}

def buildJob = Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName('citytest');
return getAllBuildNumbers(buildJob)
----

. Under +Build Environment+, select +Generic-Artifactory Integration+.
* Select your Artifactory server.
* Select +ext-releases_local+ as the +Target Respoitory+.
+
Resolved Artifacts:: `libs-releases-local:citytest/${BUILD_VERSION}/*=>artifacts`
+
* Ensure +Capture and Publish Build Info+ is checked.

. Check +Mask Passwords+, then Add:
+
Name:: +CF_PASSWORD+
Password:: Your Pivotal Web Services Password

. Under +Build+, add a +Execute Shell+ build step. Replace in the script below +uniquetoken+ with something like your username!
+
Command::
+

----

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build With Parameters''. Select the build you created in the previous step from the drop list. You should see the build deploy to Cloud Foundry.

=== Create the Trigger

. Return to the +citytest+ project and click +Configure+.

. Under +Post Build Actions+ add a post-build action, selecting +Trigger parameterized build on other projects+.
+
Projects to build:: +citytest-deploy+
Predefined parameters:: +BUILD_VERSION=$BUILD_NUMBER+

. Save the config and try running the build by clicking ``Build Now''. You should see both builds executed coupled with a zero-downtime deploy of the app to Cloud Foundry.

=== Make a Commit and Watch the Pipeline Run

. In your local clone of the +cities+ project, open +src/main/java/org/example/cities/VersionController.java+ in an editor.

. Change the version number in the string.

. Execute +git commit -am "change version number"+.

. Execute +git push origin master+.

. You should see both builds executed coupled with a zero-downtime deploy of the app to Cloud Foundry!
