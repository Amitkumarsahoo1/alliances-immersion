= Developer Experience

== Goals

To deploy and configure a microservice and UI, leverage the platform for monitoring & management, and automate a continuous delivery pipeline.

== Exercises

This section provides a high level overview of the basic concepts and components developers will leverage.

* link:dev-basics.adoc[Developer Basics]
** The Command Line Interface
** Targeting
** Console basics
** Orgs, spaces, roles and permissions
** Quotas

=== Applications & Services

Now, we need applications to deploy to Pivotal CF.  The `pcf-immersion-workshop` project you forked has a directory called `cities` we will use for this section.

* Review the material on link:microservices.adoc[microservices & app best practices]

* Review the link:https://github.com/pcf-alliances-immersion/pcf-immersion-workspace/tree/master/cities[overview] of the `cities` repository.  It is important to understand the components of this project as we will use them throughout the remainder of the class.
