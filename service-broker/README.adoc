= Service Brokers

== Goal

In this section, students will create and deploy a custom service broker.

== Exercise

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/services/[Creating Custom Services]

. Build a custom service broker that demonstrates and documents the following:
* Deployed broker (restful endpoint) visible to the cloud controller
* Successfully registers the broker with the Cloud Controller via the CLI
* Exposes a catalog containing one or more plans visible in the marketplace
* Clearly documents the functionality that should be executed in the backing service when the following events occur:
** Create service instance
** Delete a service instance
** Bind a service instance to an application
** Unbind a service instance from an application
* Creates and destroys service instances
* Bind/unbinds service instances from applications
* Bind your service to your custom built micro service
* Code pushed to a git repository accessible to Pivotal trainers

=== Resources and Clarifications

* In the interest of time, the data store should be manually installed in a VM.

* Spring developers can use the link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/spring-boot-cf-service-broker[Spring Boot CF Service Broker]

* You following repositories can be used as a reference:
** link:https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/s3-cf-service-broker[S3 CF Service Broker]
** link:https://github.com/spgreenberg/spring-boot-cf-service-broker-mongo[Spring Boot CF Service Broker Mongo]

=== Advanced Criteria

If you want to go above the requirements above, ensure your broker handles one or more of the following:

* Exposes service dashboard
* Enforce resource/service limiting plans in backing service
* Return resources based on the Org/Space
* Deploy and register the new broker through a BOSH errand
* Create an Ops Manager tile that could be distributed through Pivotal Network
