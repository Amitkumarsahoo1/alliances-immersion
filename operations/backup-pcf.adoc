= Backing Up Pivotal CF

== Goal

To understand how to backup and restore a Pivotal CF installation.

== Exercise

. Review the documentation on link:http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-settings.html[Backing up Pivotal CF]

. In the interest of time, we will skip the complete backup.

. Instead, simply export the Ops Manager installation settings and commit them in a folder called `Ops Manager Backup` in your github project.
